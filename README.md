# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This component responsive for any devices started with Mobile first approach.

Then I used display: flex method to align card at center of the page

I used <picture> tag to change two images between page width ranges.

Colours I selected from colorhunt.io site

Languages I used for this component,
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. SCSS

All feedback is greatly appreciated!
